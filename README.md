## About ZATRANO

ZATRANO is a Go web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. ZATRANO takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- Simple, fast routing engine
- Powerful application container and service providers
- Multiple back-ends for session and cache storage
- Expressive database query builder and ORM
- Database agnostic schema migrations
- Robust background job processing
- Real-time event broadcasting
- Validation, authentication, authorization, mail, and notifications

ZATRANO keeps Go’s performance and clarity while giving you an opinionated application structure and the tools required for large, robust applications.
